The output should be:
the number is 20
'''
print('the number is' , 20) # Just replace the + with a ,
# print('the number is ' + str(20)) # Alternative Solution: Here we convert it int 20 to string with str()
# print('the number is ' + f'{20}') # Alternative Solution: use the f'{}' method
# print('the number is ' + '20') # Alternative Solution: Just put two '' around 20 to make it string.
# print('the number is 20') # Alternative Solution: just literally print it.
